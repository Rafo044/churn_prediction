Introduction The goal of this project is to prepare data for customer churn prediction . We checked the data, did EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and suggested preprocessing steps. Dataset description: 1000 rows 5 columns: CustomerID \u2013 unique ID for each customer Age \u2013 customer age (18\u201365) Gender \u2013 M or F MaritalStatus \u2013 Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed IncomeLevel \u2013 Low, Medium, High 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 2.1 Age Distribution Customer ages are mainly between 18 and 65. The age distribution is quite even, but some ages look too frequent (synthetic data sign). ![[Pasted image 20250820210024.png]] 2.2 Gender Distribution Gender is almost equal (balanced). ![[Pasted image 20250820210056.png]] 2.3 MaritalStatus vs IncomeLevel IncomeLevel Divorced Married Single Widowed High 82 98 75 94 Low 87 86 62 90 Medium 79 77 78 92 Observation: High and Medium income are evenly spread in all marital groups. Low income is similar but Single customers are fewer. 2.4 MaritalStatus vs AgeGroup AgeGroup Divorced Married Single Widowed <18 4 8 7 5 18\u201335 80 84 69 93 36\u201350 67 76 63 77 51\u201365 76 67 64 76 65+ 21 26 12 25 Observation: Age group 18\u201335 is the largest in all marital groups. Widowed is more common in young people (synthetic data). Age 65+ has mostly Married and Widowed. ![[Pasted image 20250820210137.png]] 2.5 IncomeLevel vs AgeGroup AgeGroup High Low Medium <18 4 10 10 18\u201335 121 105 100 36\u201350 94 98 91 51\u201365 105 86 92 65+ 25 26 33 Observation: High income is mainly 18\u201335 (121 people). Low and Medium incomes are balanced across ages. Age 65+ mostly has Medium income. ![[Pasted image 20250820210153.png]] ![[Pasted image 20250820210226.png]] 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Missing values: None. Outliers: Age has no extreme values (range 18\u201365). Feature Engineering: Added AgeGroup (<18, 18\u201335, 36\u201350, 51\u201365, 65+). Encoding: Gender \u2192 Binary (M=1, F=0) MaritalStatus, IncomeLevel, AgeGroup \u2192 One-hot encoding Normalization: Age can be scaled using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler. Redundant Columns: CustomerID is not needed for the model. 4. Findings (Main observations) Age is strongly related to IncomeLevel and MaritalStatus. Age 18\u201335 dominates both marital status and high income groups. Widowed in young people and many young high-income customers are signs of synthetic data. Dataset does not fully match real-world patterns but is useful for model preparation. 5.
